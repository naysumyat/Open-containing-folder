Open-containing-folder
======================

This is an extension to brackets to add functionality of opening folder on your computer
containing the specified file. There are 3 ways to use it - 

* **Sidebar.** Right click on any file/folder in the sidebar and select 'Open containing folder'.
* **File > Open containing folder** To open folder containing current document (that is open in Editor).
* **Keyboard shortcut.** Ctrl-Alt-O, to open folder containing current document (that is open in Editor).

This option is not available for files in working set, as when you click them, they are made current document
and then other two options can be used.
